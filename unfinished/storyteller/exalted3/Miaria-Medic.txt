+info BGStory=The only words Miaria's only known parent spoke after her birth was her name. The event took place in a hospital-wagon the travelling dancer (who, laden with child, couldn't exactly perform) couldn't normally afford... but Kurusk the Healer, a wise and shrewd but kindly old woman turned away nobody in true need.%R%RSo when the mother died shortly after giving birth, Kurusk saw a child in need and adopted her as her own grand daughter to raise.%R%RMiaria never had a hometown. A strong bond existed between the restless merchant prince Zebram Bronx and Kurusk, and he always, ALWAYS hired the old woman to go everywhere as his personal physician as well as doctor for the caravan's staff and sometimes hangers-on. But Kurusk was old, very old, and Miaria curious indeed! Naturally, Miaria was raised to replace her... she wouldn't live forever, after all.%R%RMany hours of every day were spent learning about injuries and maladies, diseases and the ways they bring death.... most importantly, how to stave them off. How to mend and cleanse the body, how to care for the sick. How to cook meals they can eat, how to look after them... what she couldn't teach so well was convincing people of what they didn't want to hear, but when you hang around someone enough...%R%RDespite all the travelling, Miaria was sheltered much of her life. Always in the wagon or roaming the caravan, only rarely enjoying any time in a city or town when it made stops! She didn't get out much...%R%RSo when time finally claimed Kurusk's life, a rare and peaceful death of old age, and she was left alone, Miaria sank into depression for days. It only wasn't weeks because someone in the caravan who everyone thought just had the creeping crud turned out to have the Plague instead.%R%R%TOops.%R%RNormally, some dabs of Seven Bounties Paste would solve EVERYTHING, but the available supply was far too low to make it work - most had been sold, and only dregs were left. Miaria had only one recourse: she had to finish an incomplete concoction that Kurusk had been working on to make the small amount left count. Failure was NOT an option.%R%RWhether through luck, fate, skill, or some combination thereof... she managed it. When she emerged from the sealed quarantine wagon, not a soul had died... but quite a few had seen the radiant light of her anima before it dwindled.%R%RWith help from Zebram Bronx, Miaria's managed to keep the truth of that day mostly a secret. But how long she'll remain with the Guild remains to be seen...%R%RShe has seen too many miserable patients even in her short life so far, and wants to use the sun's blessing to ensure she'll never have to see them again.

@desc me=%TAt first glance, Miaria doesn't seem like a very unusual face in the Southeast. Standing at a fairly average 5'6", her light emerald green hair would simply roll down her back were it not done up into a ponytail (starting from the back of her head) to keep it mostly under control. Her youthful face is somewhat pale for the region, a sure bet that she's not spent much time outdoors, but her eyes are a regal purple.%R%R%TYes, at first glance, she doesn't seem like much, but when eyes travel downwards and look a bit more another story unfolds. Though not unusually curvy, she's undoubtedly a modestly gifted young woman who's perhaps moving into her early twenties.%R%R%TMiaria dresses rather luxuriously in an outfit of splendidly-arranged white, pink, purple, and gold. Over top of a dark pink undershirt she wears a stylishly tailored white sleeveless tunic with gold trim, held in place by a series of gold (or rather, likely gold-plated) clasps down the middle. This arrangement parts and skirts out when it meets a thick leather belt that's heavily adorned with all manner of pouches and satchels, revealing the pink undershirt before that too ends. Bare leg only shows briefly before it's swallowed up by thigh-high thin black stockings that dive into white leather boots that come nearly up to her knees. These are matched with a pair of nearly shoulder-length white gloves and flashy golden armbands. Lastly, a cape's draped over her back. The outer side is a bright white, but the inner side is a regal purple matching her eyes. It extends down to just past her waist.%R%R%TShe is rarely seen without a silver (or rather, likely silver-plated) staff. The bottom ends in a bulging point (quite suitable for a traveler's staff) while the top ends in a small crimson jewel.
