"Softcode" refers to the contents of every file in this package with the exception of Myrddin's MUSH Cron and the patches for Mercutio's SceneSys and Javelin's Anomaly Jobs. (All hail them and their fine authors!) "Game" refers to any copy of PennMUSH or similar program it's running on.

	C) You may not market the Softcode commercially or use it on games that are pay-to-play.

Support is limited by my time and energy, but it's my goal to provide an easy-to-use and expansive suite of MUSHcode for all fans of the gaming platform to enjoy. If you have questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please email them to me at the address given above.

-=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=-<* REQUIREMENTS *>-=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=--=-
1) PennMUSH 1.8.5p5 or higher - much of my code requires @dolist to have /inline and /nobreak switches and a few bug fixes only available from then on. You can obtain the latest version here: https://code.google.com/p/pennmush/
2) A WIZARD character to install and maintain the code. (do NOT use #1 for this except where specified!)
3) In mush.cnf, under TinyMUSH compatability, null_eq_zero must be 'Yes.'
4) Ideally, access to #1's STARTUp - you'll need to get creative - or lucky - without it.
